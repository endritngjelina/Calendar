# Calendar

This project showcases a series of visual calendar UI prototypes made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each version explores a different design or layout idea, from simple to more refined.

## Features

- Clean, responsive calendar layouts
- Multiple design iterations
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript – no frameworks

## File Structure

Each HTML file represents a separate design version:
- `calendar 1.html` through `calendar 18.html`

## Purpose

This project is part of a series of front-end UI explorations. It's meant for learning, experimenting, and refining design thinking.
